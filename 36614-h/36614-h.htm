<h1>THE CHILD WHO DIED AND<br />
LIVED AGAIN.</h1>

<hr />
<p>Did you ever see a person who was
dead? Perhaps you have seen one of
your own brothers or sisters lying on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
death-bed. What a change takes place
when we die! No more breath comes out
of the mouth, no colour is seen on the
cheeks; the eye can look at us no longer,
nor the tongue speak to us; the body
soon grows cold and stiff; it has no more
feeling than the ground on which we
tread. And why? Because the soul is
gone out of the body. While the soul or
spirit is in us we are alive, but when it is
gone out then we are dead. The soul
can never die, but the body is only made
of dust, and it soon crumbles away and
becomes dust again.</p>

<p>No one can make a dead person alive
again. Yet once there was a man in this
world who made dead people alive. Who
was that man? He was called Jesus; he
was not only a man, he was God too; he
was the Son of God. Most people would
not believe that he was the Son of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
though he said he was. Yet we are sure
he said true, for if he had been a wicked
man he could not have made dead people
alive again. God his Father was with
him, and this was the reason he did such
wonderful things.</p>

<p>One day a rich man came to Jesus,
and fell down at his feet, and begged him
to come to his house. He said, "My
little daughter is dying." He was very
unhappy, he loved his little girl very
much, and she was his only child. His
name was Jairus, but I do not know the
name of his little girl. I do know her
age, she was twelve years old. The
father thought that if Jesus only put his
hands upon her he could make her well.</p>

<p>The Son of God was very kind to people
in trouble. He went with the father,
and a great crowd followed him. As he
went along the road, he was pressed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
every side by those who wanted to see
him and to hear what he said.</p>

<p>Before he reached the sick man's
house, some people came and said to the
father, "Your daughter is dead." They
told him it was now of no use for Jesus
to come. They little knew what he
could do; but Jesus said to the father,
"Do not be afraid, she shall be made
well."</p>

<p>When he came to the house, he only
allowed three of his friends to come in
with him. Their names were Peter,
James, and John. There was a great
noise and bustle in the house; there were
men playing music, and people weeping
and crying out with loud voices because
the girl was dead. When Jesus came
into the room where she was lying, he
said to these people, "Why do you make
this noise? The girl is not dead, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
only sleeps." Then they began to laugh
at him, for they knew the child was dead.
Why did Jesus say she slept? Because
she was soon to be made alive. Her death
was like sleep.</p>

<p>Jesus would not let the people who
mocked, stay in the room, but he let the
girl's father and mother be there, and his
own three friends. There were just these
five in the room with him when he went
to the bed and took hold of the girl's
hand and said, "Girl, I say unto thee,
arise." Immediately her spirit (or her
soul) came again into her body. Then
she was alive. She was now quite well;
she was not weak now, as she had been;
she got up out of her bed and walked
about. Then Jesus desired that something
might be given her to eat. Her
parents were very much surprised. They
had been afraid that Jesus would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
able to make her alive. They did not
know he could do everything. He made
all our bodies and gave us souls, and one
day he will call all the dead people out of
their graves.</p>

<p>I wonder whether that young girl loved
Jesus. She was old enough to understand
what he said. At twelve years old children
can understand almost as well as
men and women can; they learn more
quickly, and remember better. Though
they love play still, they have a great
deal of sense. Some children at twelve
years old begin to take great pains with
their learning; then they get on very fast.
Some begin to be very useful; they can
do more now than take care of the baby
or run upon errands, and often they get
places as servants. If they are steady,
and tell no lies, they are trusted and get
on well in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Some children at twelve years old
begin to think about their souls and to
say, "What would become of me if I
were to die?" They go and hear sermons,
and they can understand them. They
look in the Bible, and they can understand
a great deal which they read. Then
some begin to pray and to say, "Merciful
God, give me thy Holy Spirit, for the
sake of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>But there are some who at twelve
years old will mind their parents no
longer. They say, "We are not little
babies now, we will do as we please."
They forget all the kindness their parents
have shown them for twelve years, and
they forget the words that God has
spoken, "Honour thy father and thy
mother."</p>

<p>You can read the history of the
daughter of Jairus in your Bible in Mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
v. verses 23, 24, and 35 to end; Luke
viii. 41, 42, and 49 to end.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
